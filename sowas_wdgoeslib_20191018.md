## Wikidata
*we can't repeat it too many times what Wikidata is*
**Wikidata is a**

* structured
* multilingual
* open accesible and modifiable (CC 0)
* collaborative 

**knowledgraph**

## Usage of Wikidata in GLAMs

* A central hub for authority files
* Open bibliographic database (#WikiCite)
* "Sum of all GLAMs" - institutional register

**let us use it as knowledge base to discover our resources!**

## ok. and now?

*so, that's nice but what's so new about it?*

**can you query your local authority data in the same depth?**

* locations (birth, death, work) can be easily retrieved by accessing through greater entities (if modelled)
* received awards
* and combine all the different properties?

## be open

**You can improve the discoverability as fast as you can type**

*ok, so that's also open for wrong information*

**It is, but at the same time it stays open for everyone (so also for our clients too) open to correct them**
